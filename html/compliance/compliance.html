The Act is a set of protocol with the purpose of administering improved health care insurance as well as to cut down healthcare billing fraud.  There are other contributing sections of the Act associated with helping to simplify the administrative process and confidentiality of health information.  
</p>
                    <p><strong>HIPAA amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by:  </strong>

<li>Enhance maneuverability and continuance of health insurance coverage in collective and individual markets.</li>

<li>Encounter and reduce corruption and fraudulence in health insurance and healthcare delivery.</li>

<li>Advocating the use of medical savings accounts.</li>

<li>Easy accessibility to health coverage and services.</li>

<li>Easing out the management of health insurance.</li>


 </p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Act aids in better supervision and confidentiality of patient information and records.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1998 upped security standards for electronic health data by implementing as a part of the HIPAA provisions act Nation Standard Provider Identifier (NPI) and National Standard Employer Identifier.<br><br>

Proficiency in healthcare delivery through electronic transmission of financial and administrative operations as well as security of confidential health information have been enhanced by the Administrative Simplification rules of HIPAA.<br><br>

<strong>HIPAA Readiness</strong><br>

We earnestly address all compliance related worries of our customers and handle them proactively, be it the confidentiality of their electronic data or its physical safeguard at out production centers.  We attend to all these requirements in our safe and secure cutting edge production and delivery center which accommodates highly advanced technological infrastructure available to international businesses. Here is how we go beyond the fundamentals.<br><br>

<strong>Secrecy of Data</strong><br>
Due to the delicate and sensitive nature of patient healthcare data and information, all our personnel work on computers which do not have access to e-mail, have no floppy or CD drives, and not even USB ports.  This ensures that the confidential data cannot be moved or transferred anywhere.<br><br>

Additional security is maintained by installation of firewalls in all systems and particular clientele networks are also physically isolated.  Our personnel have restricted entry to the client's software program applications thereby enabling them to execute the required services in a totally secure atmosphere.  <br><br>

<strong>Physical Safety Measures</strong><br>
All office personnel are thoroughly screened before entering or leaving the production center.  All bags, mobile phones, cameras, etc., are to be kept outside the production center thereby ensuring no way of theft of data.  The facility is physically locked down with entry only to authorized staff.  Furthermore the facility is physically protected by installation of card readers and biometric technology in all entry and exit points.  Around the clock 24 hour guards are stationed at entry and exit points to safeguard from any unauthorized access. <br><br>

<strong>Employing Staff & Background Checks</strong><br>
Thorough background checks are conducted by our HR department on all new employees before they are confirmed into the organization.  Employees can access our systems only with valid logins and passwords.  Additional access to sensitive information is only on a "need to know basis" and only can be accessed by authorized employees.  Furthermore all our executive staff <strong>receive confidentiality training (as required by HIPAA) and sign confidentiality agreements.</strong>
